This module contains code to create a resizable array of any type.
You simply need to run the perl generalise script by typing:
./generalise
It should walk you through the process of making your own dynamicaly resized array
and example of the script is as follows:

>./generalise
Name dynamic array                                                                                                                                                                          
>DynarrayUint8_t                                                                                                                                                     
Data type the array will hold:                                                                                                                                                             
>uint8_t                                                                                                                                                                                    
Name the structure for main.c ---Maybe something similar to (but not the same as) the name of the dynammic array:                                                                  
>dynarray_uint8_t                                                                                                                                                                      
Name the module:                                                                                                                                                                          
>dynarrayu8    

This will create a module called "dynarrayu8" in its own folder with C files of the same name.

The data type that will be defined in the .h file will be "DynarrayUint8_t" and it will hold
a resizable array containing uint8_ts.

The structure used to represent this datatype will be called "dynarray_uint8_t"

A simple Makefile will be generated to compile the module
NOTE: uint8_t is not in the base C language. To make this example module compile you will have to
include <stdint.h> in the .c and/or .h file produced.

I have made an automated testsuit for the module dynarrayChar.
to use it run "make test". if you want to run valgrind on the executable type:
"make test-full"

It is up to you to write automated testsuites for the code produced by this module.

I hope this is educational! Have fun!

(PS you can have a resizeable array of void * if you want this data structure to work for many types.)
